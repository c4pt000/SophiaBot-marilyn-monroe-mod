template build design is garbage from too many variables inter mixing into disconnected logical meanings to an extent,
(too many chefs spoil the soup -< 
template -> x template -> x template -> z template -z

my opinion

templates needed to be seperate concepts and possibly allowable by end user to install as mods or expansionability
